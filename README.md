# MealDB-DTO


Example code that goes along with the article [Working With the JSON You Get](https://sanguish.ghost.io/the-json-you-get)

The [Swift-tests branch](https://github.com/sanguish/MealDB-DTO/tree/Swift-tests) extends that code to go along with the [DTO Testing with the New Swift Testing System](https://www.attributedstrings.com/dto-revisit-testing/) article.
